# discord_bot
my first discord bot

The aim is to make a linear algebra solver using discord bot as I always use discord as my main chatting app. 

Currently there are 3 command exists:

1. !meme - Post random meme 
2. !solve-eigen - Solving Eigenvalues Problems (only Symmetrical problem)
3. !matmul  - Matrix Multiplications

Examples:

!matmul -m1 [[5, 1, 3], [2, 0, 2], [0, 1, 5]] -m2 [[5, 4, 3], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 5]]

!solve-eigen [[5, 1, 3], [2, 0, 2], [0, 1, 5]]
